# Mini Assessment - Movie Quote System

* Modify `movie_system.py` to solve the problem as stated in the TODO comments.
* Use the `movies.txt` file for the list of directors and movie quotes to select from.
* You can run the program using the instructions in *To Run* below.
* You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests as in the section *To Test* below.

### To Run

* `python3 movie_system.py`
* follow the input prompts to get a random movie quote

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_movie_system.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_movie_system.MyTestCase.test_1_choose_movie_file`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
