# Basic Banking

In this exercise, you must implement the Bank class for a customer's banking system. Have a look at the tests to understand what is expected.

You will also have to do a little bit of research about the `uuid.uuid4()` function. This function generates a random UUID. You can use it to generate account numbers for the customers.

You'll notice that we're using some custom exceptions. This is also worth understanding. You can read more about exceptions in Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html).
